    "## Part 1: From Real World Data to Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last two blogs, I introduced you to vector databases, showed you how to set up your enviornment, spin up a Qdrant cloud instance, and create your first collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to get practical. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, you'll gain an intuition for the process of turning real-world text data into vectors and adding them to your Qdrant collection. To follow along with this, [you'll need an OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/). OpenAI requires to put some money down upfront. I recommend putting down $20. If you can't afford that, then [Cohere is a good option](https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login). Cohere lets you access their models for free, without having to enter any credit card information. However, there are rate limits to their free tier. At the time of this writing, you can't send more than 5 requests per minute, 100 requests per hour, and 1000 requests per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "I primarily use OpenAI because I've spent enough with them that I'm at teir 4 usage limits. This means I can experiment, explore, and hack around as much as I need before commiting to something that I'm going to present to you. No other reason than that. You're free to use whatever language model provider you'd like. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From Text to Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the most out vector search, you need to transform human-readable text into a format that machines can understand and process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization:** Breaking down the text into smaller units called tokens. These can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the chosen tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding:**  Mapping each token to a vector in a high-dimensional space. Each dimension captures some aspect of the token's meaning and its relationship to other tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vector Representation:** The resulting set of vectors represents the entire text, capturing its semantic meaning and relationships within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://qdrant.tech/docs/gettingstarted/tokenization.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "[Image Source: Qdrant Blog](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/overview/vector-search/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization involves:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Splitting the text into words, subwords, or characters\n",
    "\n",
    " - Converting each token into a unique integer ID\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the time of this writing, OpenAI uses a tokenizer called `cl100k_base` for it's new models. This includes `text-embedding-3-large`, which will be used in this tutorial. The  `cl100k_base` tokenizer is based on [byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm](https://youtu.be/HEikzVL-lZU). BPE iteratively replaces the most frequent pair of bytes with a single, unused byte. This allows for effective encoding of rare words and subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "For words in the English language, tokens are typically single characters, partial, or complete words. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the sentence \"Coding is fun!\" would be split into the following tokens: \"Coding,\" \"is,\" \"fun,\" \"!\". However, the concept of a token can differ across languages. Some languages might have tokens smaller than a single character or larger than one word, depending on the language's structure. When it comes to spaces, they are usually considered part of the preceding word during tokenization. For example, \"learning\" would be a token, not \"learning \" or \" + learning.\" For an excellent deep dive into tokenization, including a comparison of different tokenizers on the same piece of text, I recommend checking out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT6wVLEDC_w) by Jay Alammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "[There's also this cool web app](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/?model=text-embedding-3-large) shows you how the `cl100k_base` tokenizer does its thing. Take a look below.\n",
